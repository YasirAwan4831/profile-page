7.	After that, write another <h2> with the text Useful Links, and in a <p> tag, add anchor (<a>) tags to link your LinkedIn profiles. Example:
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yasirawan4831/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>

8.	Finally, write another <h2> titled My Photo, and below that add an image tag like:
